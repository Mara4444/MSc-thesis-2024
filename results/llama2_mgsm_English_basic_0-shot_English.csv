Answer: Wendi needs to give her chickens 30 cups of feed in the final meal of the day if the size of her flock is 20 chickens.

Explanation:

Wendi gives her chickens 3 cups of feed per chicken per day, so for 20 chickens, she needs to give 60 cups of feed per day (3 cups per chicken x 20 chickens = 60 cups).

Since Wendi gives her chickens 3 meals per day, she needs to give 20 cups of feed per meal (60 cups / 3 meals per day = 20 cups per meal).

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day if the size of her flock is 20 chickens."

Let's break this down step by step:

1. John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, which means he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 60 mph x 3 hours = 180 miles

2. Then, he turns around and heads back home, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. During this time, he doesn't move at all, so the distance he covers is 0 miles.
3. After the 2 hours of standstill traffic, he starts driving again and spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph. During this time, he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 30 mph x 0.5 hours = 15 miles

4. Finally, he drives the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph. During this time, he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time = 80 mph x 4 hours = 320 miles

So, at the end of the 4 hours, John is 335 miles away from home (180 + 15 + 320)."

Answer:

Carlos will start earning money on the lemon tree in 6 years.

Explanation:

To calculate the number of years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to calculate the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree, and then compare it to the total revenue he will earn from selling the lemons.

Total cost of planting and maintaining the tree = $90 + ($3 x 7 years) = $90 + $21 = $111

Total revenue from selling lemons = 7 lemons x $1.5 each = $10.5

Since the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree is greater than the total revenue from selling the lemons, it will take Carlos 6 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

Therefore, the answer is 6 years."

Answer: 3 miles per hour

Explanation:

Marissa has already walked 4 miles in 1 hour, so her average speed for that distance is 4 miles per hour. To find her average speed for the remaining distance, we need to divide the distance left to walk by the time she has left to walk. In this case, the distance left to walk is 8 miles (12 miles - 4 miles she has already walked), and she has 2 hours left to walk (1 hour for the first 4 miles and 1 hour for the next 2 miles). Therefore, her average speed for the remaining distance is:

8 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour

So, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 3 miles per hour to cover the remaining distance of 8 miles in 2 hours."

Answer:
Cynthia will spend $240 on ice cream over 60 days.

Explanation:
To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream, we need to multiply the number of servings she eats per day by the number of days she eats ice cream. Since she eats one serving of ice cream every night, she will eat 30 servings of ice cream in 60 days (30 nights x 1 serving per night).

Next, we multiply the number of servings by the cost per serving: $4.00 per carton x 15 servings per carton = $60.00 per carton. Since Cynthia buys cartons of ice cream, we divide the total cost by the number of servings in each carton to find her total cost: $60.00 per carton / 15 servings per carton = $4.00 per serving.

Finally, we multiply the total cost per serving by the number of servings Cynthia will eat over 60 days: $4.00 per serving x 30 servings = $120.00.

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $120.00 on ice cream over 60 days."

Answer: $42

Explanation:
Gloria has to choose between the boots and two pairs of heels. Let's call the cost of the first pair of heels x. Since the second pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, the cost of the second pair is 2x.

The total cost of the three options is:

* Boots: $42
* First pair of heels: x
* Second pair of heels: 2x

We know that the total cost of the three options is equal to $50, so we can set up the equation:

$42 + x + 2x = $50

Solving for x, we get:

x = $33

So the cost of the first pair of heels is $33. Since the second pair of heels costs twice as much, the cost of the second pair is $66.

Therefore, the boots cost $42."

Answer: 30

Explanation:
Let's say the number of silver coins Gretchen has is x. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is x + 30.

We know that Gretchen has 110 coins in total, so the sum of the number of silver and gold coins she has is 110:

x + (x + 30) = 110

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us:

2x = 80

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 40

So, Gretchen has 40 silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, Gretchen has 30 + 40 = 70 gold coins."

Answer:
Polly could stand 1300 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the gold javelin if she was holding the sapphire gemstone.

Explanation:
When Polly held the sapphire gemstone, she could throw the gold javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. So, the maximum distance Polly could throw the javelin without the gemstone is 400 feet (the distance she could throw it without the gemstone). Multiplying this distance by three gives us the maximum distance Polly could throw the javelin with the gemstone: 1200 feet. Since the dragon's flames only reach a distance of 1000 feet, Polly could stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit it with the javelin if she was holding the sapphire gemstone. However, since Polly could throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone, she could stand an additional 300 feet away from the dragon (for a total of 1300 feet) and still hit it with the javelin if she was holding the sapphire gemstone."

To determine how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the number of servings in a bag, you can use the following calculation:

Total daily calorie target - Number of calories in a serving x Number of servings in the bag = Total number of grams of chips you can eat

In this case, your daily calorie target is 2000 calories, and you have already consumed 1800 calories. If a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, each serving has 250 calories. Therefore, the total number of grams of chips you can eat is:

2000 - 250 x 5 = 1250 grams

So, you can eat up to 1250 grams of chips based on your daily calorie target and the number of servings in a bag."

Answer:

Let's start by using the information that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, if he buys x blue ties, he buys 2x red ties.

We know that the red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, so the cost of one red tie is 50% more than the cost of one blue tie. Let's call the cost of one blue tie $x. Then the cost of one red tie is $x + 50%.

We also know that John spent $200 on ties. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he spent $200/2 = $100 on blue ties.

So, the total cost of the red ties is $100 + (2x + 50%) = $100 + $2x + $50%.

We can simplify this equation by substituting the value of x = $40, which is the cost of one blue tie.

Total cost of red ties = $100 + $2(40) + $50% = $100 + $80 + $50% = $180

Therefore, John spent $180 on ties."

Let's assume the building has a total of x units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, the number of occupied units is 3x/4.

Since each floor has 8 units, the number of unoccupied units on each floor is 8 - 3x/4.

The total number of unoccupied units in the building is the sum of the number of unoccupied units on each floor:

Total unoccupied units = 8 - 3x/4 + 8 - 3x/4 +... + 8 - 3x/4

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Total unoccupied units = 8(3x/4 - 1)

So, there are 8(3x/4 - 1) unoccupied units in the building.

Since x is the total number of units in the building, we can substitute x = 15:

Total unoccupied units = 8(3(15)/4 - 1)
= 8(30 - 1)
= 8(29)
= 224

Therefore, there are 224 unoccupied units in the building."

Answer:

Let's start by using the information we know to set up an equation. Let x be the number of miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

We know that Sophia has traveled 100 miles since last filling her tank, so she has used 100 / 4 = 25 gallons of gas.

We also know that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas, so we can set up the equation:

25 = x / 12

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 25 x 12 = 300 miles

So, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas."

Answer:

Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.  So, if he spends 2 hours watching TV, he spends 1 hour reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in 1 week, he spends:

2 hours x 3 times/week = 6 hours/week on TV
1 hour x 3 times/week = 3 hours/week on reading

In 4 weeks, he spends:

6 hours/week x 4 weeks = 24 hours/week on TV
3 hours/week x 4 weeks = 12 hours/week on reading

Therefore, Jim spends 24 hours/week on TV and 12 hours/week on reading in 4 weeks."

"Response: 

Answer:

Let's start by using the information given in the problem:

* There were 175 diamonds.
* There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds.
* There were twice as many emeralds as rubies.

We can use these clues to create a system of equations to solve for the total number of gems in the chest:

Number of diamonds = 175
Number of rubies = 35 - x
Number of emeralds = 2x

where x is the total number of rubies.

Now, we can substitute the values given in the problem:

Number of diamonds = 175
Number of rubies = 35 - 35
Number of emeralds = 2(35)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

175 = 35 - 70
2x = 70

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 35

So, there were 35 rubies in the chest.

Now, let's find the total number of gems in the chest:

Number of diamonds = 175
Number of rubies = 35
Number of emeralds = 2x

Substituting the values, we get:

175 + 35 + 2(35) = 600

Simplifying, we get:

175 + 35 + 70 = 600

So, there were 600 gems in the chest.

Therefore, the answer is 600."

Answer:
Let's start by using the information that there are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. This means that for every girl, there are 2 boys.

So, if there are x girls at the school, there are 2x boys.

We know that the total number of students at the school is 60 + 5x.

We also know that there are 5 students to every teacher, so the number of teachers is 5(60 + 5x).

We can simplify this equation by substituting the value of x, which we know is 20 (since there are twice as many boys as girls).

So, the number of teachers is 5(80 + 5(20)).

Can you simplify this equation and find the answer?"

Answer:

Let's assume that Gerald's original time for the 400-meter hurdles was x seconds. Since Lee used to be able to run it 2 seconds faster than Gerald, Lee's time was x + 2 seconds.

After changing his diet, Gerald's speed improved by 10%, which means that his new time for the 400-meter hurdles is:

x + 2 = 1.10x

Now, we are given that Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald. So, Lee's time for the 400-meter hurdles is:

x + 2 = 38

Solving for x, we get:

x = 30

Answer: 4 tomatoes

Explanation:

Let's start by using the fact that each 16 ounce can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes. So, if Freda uses x cans of tomatoes, she will use 3x tomatoes.

Since the final batch of tomato sauce made 32 ounces of sauce, we can set up the following equation:

3x = 32

Now, we know that when Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. So, the volume of tomatoes she uses will be half of the volume of the sauce she makes:

x = 16

Therefore, Freda used 16 cans of tomatoes, which is equal to 4 tomatoes."

Let’s start by using the information we know to set up an equation. Let’s say the boat took on x liters of water by the time Julia reached shore.

We know that the boat was taking on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet Julia rowed back towards shore. So, if Julia rowed 20 feet back towards shore, the boat took on 2 x 20 = 40 liters of water.

Since Julia had to row 64 seconds to reach shore, we can set up the equation:

40 liters / 64 seconds = x liters

Now we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 40:

x = 64 seconds

So, by the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on 64 liters of water."

Let's start by using the information given in the problem:

* Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
* The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

So, if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, Brittany's phone can hold at least 1800 x 6 = 10,800 photographs.

Now, we know that the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is less than 10,800. Let's call this number x.

So, the problem states that the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

50 x = x + 50

Solving for x, we get:

x = 40

Answer: 25

Explanation:

Let's first calculate the time taken by Mark to complete the first test:

Time taken to complete first test = Number of questions / Questions completed per hour
= 75 / 5
= 15 hours

Since Mark had 8 hours to complete the first test, he left 7 questions incomplete:

Number of questions left incomplete = Time taken to complete test - Time available
= 15 - 8
= 7

Now, let's calculate the time taken by Mark to complete the second test:

Time taken to complete second test = Number of questions / Questions completed per hour
= 100 / 5
= 20 hours

Since Mark had 6 hours to complete the second test, he left 4 questions incomplete:

Number of questions left incomplete = Time taken to complete test - Time available
= 20 - 6
= 4

Therefore, Mark left 25 questions incomplete in total (7 from the first test and 18 from the second test)."

x + 22 = 48

Solving for x, we get:

x = 26

So, there are 26 pink gumballs in the candy machine."

To find out how much money Jordan would earn in one week if he spent his video game time working, we need to calculate how many hours he spends on video games and then multiply that by his hourly wage.

Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day, which means he spends 14 hours (2 hours/day x 7 days/week) playing video games per week.

If Jordan works 14 hours per week at $10 per hour, he would earn:

14 hours/week x $10/hour = $140/week

Answer:

Let's start by using the formula for distance = rate x time to find out how far Steve will travel in one minute:

Distance = Rate x Time
Distance = 440 ft/min x 1 min
Distance = 440 ft

Now, let's find out how far Tim will travel in one minute:

Distance = Rate x Time
Distance = 264 ft/min x 1 min
Distance = 264 ft

Since Steve lives 3 miles away from the school, it will take him 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 6.8 minutes to reach his house.

Since Tim lives 2 miles away from the school, it will take him 2 miles / 264 ft/min = 7.5 minutes to reach his house.

So, the winner will be waiting at their house for 7.5 - 6.8 = 0.75 minutes before the loser finishes the race."

Let's start by identifying the given information:

* The cost of lemons is $3 per gallon.
* The cost of sugar is $2 per gallon.
* They sell each glass for $0.50.
* They get 20 glasses per gallon.
* They made a profit of $25.

Now, let's calculate the total cost of lemons and sugar:

Total cost of lemons = Number of gallons x Cost of lemons per gallon
= 20 glasses per gallon x $3 per gallon
= $60

Total cost of sugar = Number of gallons x Cost of sugar per gallon
= 20 glasses per gallon x $2 per gallon
= $40

Now, let's calculate the total revenue:

Total revenue = Number of glasses sold x Price per glass
= 20 glasses per gallon x $0.50 per glass
= $10

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
= $10 - ($60 + $40)
= $25

So, they spent $60 on lemons and $40 on sugar, for a total of $100. They made a profit of $25, as stated in the problem."

To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3, we need to find the number of ways in which this can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. There are 3 ways to roll a number greater than 3: 4, 5, or 6. So, the probability is 3/6 = 50%.

To calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to find the number of ways in which this can happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes. There is only one way to roll two even numbers in a row: 2, 2. So, the probability is 1/6 × 1/6 = 1/36 = 2.78%."

Let the number of rats in each cage be x.

Since there are 3 cages, the total number of rats is 3x.

The problem states that each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 6x.

Since no straw is used anywhere else in the store, the total number of pieces of straw distributed is 6x + 160 = 226.

Now, we can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the number of rats and the number of pieces of straw given to them:

6x = 226

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 226 / 6

x = 37

So, there are 37 rats in each cage."

Tom has 30 trees left after 10 years.

Explanation:

Tom starts with 50 trees.

In year 1, he plants 10 trees, so he has 50 + 10 = 60 trees.

In year 2, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 60 + 10 = 70 trees.

In year 3, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 70 + 10 = 80 trees.

In year 4, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 80 + 10 = 90 trees.

In year 5, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 90 + 10 = 100 trees.

In year 6, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 100 + 10 = 110 trees.

In year 7, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 110 + 10 = 120 trees.

In year 8, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 120 + 10 = 130 trees.

In year 9, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 130 + 10 = 140 trees.

In year 10, he plants 10 trees again, so he has 140 + 10 = 150 trees.

Now, let's calculate the number of trees Tom has after 10 years:

Year 1: 60 trees
Year 2: 70 trees
Year 3: 80 trees
Year 4: 90 trees
Year 5: 100 trees
Year 6: 110 trees
Year 7: 120 trees

Adding the cost of the eraser, which is $0.30 per pen, we get:

$9.60 + ($0.30 x 8) = $9.60 + $2.40 = $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."

Answer: 190 pounds of carrots will not be used.

Explanation:

Total amount of carrots to be distributed = 200 pounds
Number of restaurants to receive carrots = 40
Amount of carrots each restaurant will receive = 2 pounds

So, the total amount of carrots that will not be used is:
200 pounds - (40 restaurants x 2 pounds/restaurant) = 190 pounds

Therefore, 190 pounds of carrots will not be used."

The number of kids in Soda is 1435.

Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of kids in Soda. We know that the total population of Soda is 23786, and that there are 8417 men and 9092 women. This means that the number of kids in Soda is equal to the total population minus the number of men and women.

So, the number of kids in Soda is:
23786 - 8417 - 9092 = 1435

Therefore, there are 1435 kids in the city of Soda."

Answer:

Micheal rode his bike for a total of 4 weeks, and he rode it at least 5 times a week. So, he rode his bike for a total of 5 x 4 = 20 times in 4 weeks.

He rode 25 kilometers each time, so he traveled a total distance of 25 km x 20 times = 500 kilometers in 4 weeks.

After that, he reduced the number of times he rode his bike to 2 times a week, but he increased the distance he rode to 60 kilometers each time. So, he rode his bike for a total of 3 weeks, and he rode it 2 times a week, for a total distance of 2 x 3 = 6 times.

He rode 60 kilometers each time, so he traveled a total distance of 60 km x 6 times = 360 kilometers in 3 weeks.

In total, Micheal rode his bike for a distance of 500 km + 360 km = 860 kilometers."

Answer:
Let's say Jerry has x red chickens. Since the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, Jerry collects 3x eggs per day.

The white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, so Jerry collects 5(x+2) eggs per day.

Since Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, we can set up the equation:

3x + 5(x+2) = 42

Solving for x, we get:

3x = 42 - 10
3x = 32
x = 12

So Jerry has 12 red chickens."

Answer:
The small pool had 4 gallons of water initially.

Reasoning:
Let's say the small pool had x gallons of water initially. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool, the big pool had 2x gallons of water initially.

Now, the big pool has 4 times as much water as the small pool, so the big pool has 4x gallons of water now.

Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool initially, the small pool had x/2 gallons of water initially.

Now, the small pool has 4 gallons of water less than the big pool, so the small pool has x/2 - 4 gallons of water now.

Therefore, the small pool has x/2 - 4 = 2 gallons of water now."

Answer: 251

Explanation:

Let's start by using the information that Naomi scored 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi, so Yuri scored:

10 + (1/2) × 68 = 10 + 34 = 44 points

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, so Brianna scored:

75 (since Naomi scored 68 points) + 17 = 92 points

Now, we know that the total number of points scored by all four students is 251, so we can set up the equation:

68 + 44 + 92 + Jojo's points = 251

Solving for Jojo's points, we get:

Jojo scored 100 points.

Therefore, the answer is 100."

Answer:

Let's start by using the information given in the problem:

* The water tank was filled with 120 liters of water.
* Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank to water her small garden.
* She was then able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left.

So, if she collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left, that means she collected 2 x 90 = 180 liters of water.

Now, let's check the total amount of water in the tank:

120 liters (initial amount) - 90 liters (used) = 30 liters (remaining amount)

So, there are 30 liters of water left in the tank after Celine used 90 liters to water her small garden and collected 180 liters of rainwater."

James has 40 water type Pokemon cards out of a total of 90 cards (30 fire type + 20 grass type + 40 water type). If he loses 8 of the water type, he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards left.

If he buys 14 grass type cards, he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.

So, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is:

(32 / 90) x 100 = 35%

Rounding to the nearest integer gives us 30%."

Answer:

Let's start by using the information given in the problem:

* Mary is two years younger than Joan.
* Joan is five years older than Jessa.
* Jessa is 20 years old.

We can start by using the first piece of information to find the age of Joan:

Joan is five years older than Jessa, so Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Next, we can use the second piece of information to find the age of Mary:

Mary is two years younger than Joan, so Mary is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

Finally, we can use the third piece of information to find the age of Jessa:

Jessa is 20 years old, so Jessa is 20 years old.

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is:

23 + 25 + 20 = 68 years old.

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years old."

Answer: 5

Explanation:

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* Griffin had 24 fries initially.
* Kyle took 5 of them, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
* Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 \* 5 = 10 fries from Griffin.
* Ginger gave Griffin a handful of fries, which we can assume to be 5 fries.
* Colby took 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle took, so Colby took 3 - 5 = -2 fries from Griffin.

Since Griffin had 27 fries in the end, we can set up the equation:

19 + 10 + 5 - 2 = 27

Solving for Ginger's contribution, we get:

Ginger gave Griffin 5 fries.

Therefore, the answer is 5."

Answer:

Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. So, if her sister ate x cookies, Sue ate 4x cookies.
* On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister. So, if her sister ate x cookies, Sue ate 2x cookies.
* Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies the next day.

Now, let's use the information to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister:

1. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 4x = 20 cookies (since her sister ate x = 5 cookies).
2. On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, so Sue ate 2x = 26 cookies (since her sister ate x = 13 cookies).

Total number of cookies eaten by Sue on Monday and Tuesday = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

Since each cookie has 200 calories, the total number of calories consumed by Sue on Monday and Tuesday = 46 cookies x 200 calories/cookie = 9200 calories.

Now, we need to find out how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister. We can do this by subtracting the number of calories consumed by her sister from the total number of calories consumed by Sue:

Difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister = 9200 calories (Sue) - 5500 calories (her sister) = 3700 calories.

Therefore, Sue consumed 3700 more calories than her sister."
